# HyDD2
HyDD2: Analysis of Hypothalamic Development Database Version 2

**Project Description**
HyDD2 is an integrative bioinformatics project aimed at studying gene expression dynamics across multiple stages of hypothalamic development. This repository includes analysis scripts for processing, clustering, and visualizing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, focusing on the regulatory networks governing hypothalamic differentiation and maturation over key developmental stages.

This project is structured to support researchers interested in single-cell sequencing, developmental biology, and the underlying mechanisms of neurogenesis in the hypothalamus.

**Data Access
Raw Data (scRNA-seq)**
NCBI GEO: Raw matrix files, including count matrices for each sample and metadata, are accessible at NCBI GEO under accession number **GSEXXXXXX.**

**Processed Data (.Robj Files)**
Figshare: Processed Seurat objects (e.g., HyDD2_Processed.Robj) can be accessed and downloaded from Figshare at **Figshare link**. These files include pre-processed and normalized data suitable for running the scripts in this repository.
